# RoomMate is an app that allows me and my roommates to post chores to a Firebase database and choose to complete them 
 #   in order to gain 'points'.  The app requires you to sign in through Facebook where it can access photos, name, email, etc...
    
# The app was made simply so that I could become more familiar with Firebase realtime database and the Facebook SDK.
